            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here preſent you with <hi>A Loyal Looking-Glaſs,</hi> which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what you and I, and all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be to their Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. I have taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to engrave your name on the cover of it, if you pleaſe to open
<pb facs="tcp:63172:3"/>
it, to preſent your ſelf before it, and examine your actions by it, ſo far as they relate to what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in it; you will ſee your ſelf the very ſame what others, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking you, have known and acknowledged you to be a <hi>Loyal Subject,</hi> which makes both for your credit and your comfort, although it hath bin heretofore laid in your diſh as your crime, by thoſe who maligned you for it, and ſought your ruine by it. But God be thanked, who gave you not over as a prey unto their teeth; that ſnare was long ſince broken, and you happily delivered.</p>
            <p>It is not my intent by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of this Treatiſe to court you to its Patronage, which were in vain, and to no purpoſe; for if ever a Diſcourſe, for its ſubject-matter, could promiſe acceptance
<pb facs="tcp:63172:3"/>
to its ſelf, and ſecurity to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, this one would think might do it to the higheſt pitch of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in that it treats of the Higher Powers, yea the higheſt both in Heaven and Earth, God and the King; calling upon us to fear the firſt for himſelf, becauſe he is ſo; and his Vice-gerent (if not for his own perſonal merits yet) for his ſake that made him ſo. From the leaſt and loweſt of theſe I might expect in equity (but in all humility) that while I defend his Royalties with my Pen, he ſhould protect my perſon with his Sword: and the rather,<note place="margin">Periculoſum eſt in eum ſcribere qui poteſt proſcribere.</note> becauſe whatever blows are made imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at me, will in ſome ſenſe reach himſelf.</p>
            <p>It hath been experimented that a Bullet piercing through a ſolid body, hath made the wound the
<pb facs="tcp:63172:4"/>
more dangerous, and its cure the more difficult, by reaſon of thoſe ragged pieces, and noxious ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which it hath forced along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. I ſhould willingly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my carkaſs between my King and danger, but it would grieve me more for him then for my ſelf, if it ſhould paſs through me and lodge it ſelf in that Royal Breaſt; more yet if that wound ſhould prove the more hazardous, as being made upon Majeſty, through the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ſides of ſuch an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of mortality.</p>
            <p>But however I may flatter my ſelf, I have cauſe to fear that theſe my hopes may fail me, ſith neither Majeſty nor Innocency it ſelf, can be a ſufficient ſhield againſt the envenomed Arrows of malicious Tongues; yet notwithſtanding one would think, that although
<pb facs="tcp:63172:4"/>
ſome may be ſo fool-hardy as not to fear the King, who may kill the body, but can do no more; yet none could be ſo ſottiſhly ſtupid as to caſt off all fear of God, who can kill both body and ſoul,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Job</hi> 9.4.</note> and caſt both into Hell; ſith never any one as yet hardned himſelf againſt him and proſpered. In reference to the one I look upon my ſelf as an inferiour Subject; under the other I am imployed by virtue of my Calling in a place of no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary truſt, being Gods Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and may expect indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Law of Nations. If any daring <hi>Hanuns,</hi> in the faithful execution of my Office ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame me, as he deformed <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants, ſhaving off their Beards by halfs, and curtailing their Garments to expoſe their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to publick view;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.</note> they may
<pb facs="tcp:63172:5"/>
well expect that God, whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter I am, ſhould reſent the affront as offered unto himſelf, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely revenge it, by wounding the heads of ſuch provoking ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch incorrigible ones as are reſolved to go on ſtill in their wickedneſs. So that if the one fail me becauſe he cannot, I am ſure the other can, yea I have it under his hand that he will protect me; he hath made me a firm promiſe that he will be with me, and having that, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care nor fear who they are that ſhall appear againſt me.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, we have lived in an Age in which that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judge hath ſome Fellows, and many more Followers; who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear God, nor reverence man. Which gives me a ſufficient <hi>Item</hi> to provide againſt thoſe ſtorms
<pb facs="tcp:63172:5"/>
which others have met with, who have embarqued themſelves in the ſame bottom; who for their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable endeavours to cleanſe and heal mens feſtered ſores, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the common Fee of galled backt Jades, a malicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful kick. While they have ſought to reduce unruly Swine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better order, they have raiſed a cry, and brought the whole Herd about their ears which have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted them with their ſtubborn Biriſtles, and injured them as much as they could with their miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous teeth. And have I any hopes of ſpeeding better?<note place="margin">Oſtendo illi lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; aſpergit me luto, oſtendo illi ſpeculum &amp; allidit parieti.</note> but that when I hold before them my Glaſs they ſhould daſh it againſt the Walls; and when I offer them water to waſh their defiled faces, they ſhould caſt dirt into mine. And it is ſad to conſider what Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
<pb facs="tcp:63172:6"/>
ſuch find among men of parts, who might do God and their King better ſervice, then by pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating other mens guilt, and ſo conſequently hardning them in thoſe ſinful courſes, from which they are bound by the Law of Chriſtian Love to do their utmoſt to reduce them, which would gain them more of love from God, and of reſpect from all good men; whereas they cannot reproach themſelves more, then by raking in the Chanel (as ſome have done) for the blackeſt dirt to beſpatter the reputation of pious and well-meaning perſons, who have ſought to inform them better.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall have that in deſign againſt me, I ſhall ſave him the pains of a private ſcrutiny by a free and publick confeſſion, that I am the greateſt of ſinners;
<pb facs="tcp:63172:6"/>
and am ſo far from ſheltring my ſelf in the Croud, or extenuating my ſins with the uſual plea, <hi>I am not alone, there are as many ſinners as men, becauſe there is no man lives and ſins not;</hi> that I could heartily more then hopefully wiſh, that there were none ſo beſide my ſelf in the world. And if this will not ſatisfie, could I in the leaſt think it would conduce to their good, or prove but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means to make them better, I would ſhame my ſelf yet more;<note place="margin">Fit plerumque ut dum iniqui in ſe mala defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere nequeaut vitia contra vitam corripien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis exquirunt, &amp; eo ſe crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſos non exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſi criminae aliis imponant; qui cum verae invenire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queant fingunt ut ipſi quoque habeant, quod non impari ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia increpare videantur. <hi>Greg.

For my part I never durſt look on anothers errour as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for my ſin; and if any do upon
<pb facs="tcp:63172:7"/>
mine for theirs, I fear they will find themſelves miſtaken in that <hi>day, when every man ſhall give an account of himſelf unto God, and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual offender ſhall be adjudged to bear his own burden.</hi> Others may think my Nails too long, and to deſerve a paring to the quick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have made ſo large an uſe of them; but theſe conſider not what an old overgrown thick skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Witch I have to deal with; and if I have ſcratcht her ſo deep as to make her bleed, it is not upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition by way of trial, but upon ſufficient conviction, and in a way of revenge. She ſtands upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for one of old,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23.</note> and hath given us freſh inſtances to aſſure us that ſhe is as deeply in league with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> as ever, and is not in the leaſt reformed; but hath within theſe few years exerciſed her devilliſh
<pb facs="tcp:63172:7"/>
art in bewitching many thouſands of our fellow-ſubjects. It is her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and their cure that put me upon this project.</p>
            <p>But laſt of all, and that which troubles me not leaſt of all, is the thoughts that I may hereby expoſe my ſelf to the cenſure, if not to the envy of my elder Brethren; who perhaps will impute it to <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vain-glory,</hi> that ſuch a Stripling as I ſhould conceive any hopes with my ſling to proſtrate that great <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> who hath wrought ſo ſtrange a conſternation in the whole Army of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But I dare appeal for my integrity to <hi>God, the ſearcher of all hearts,</hi> who is my witneſs that theſe Notes had never ſeen the light, had I in all my reading met with any Author in ſo great a ſurfeit of Books of all ſorts, who hath handled this ſubject in our
<pb facs="tcp:63172:8"/>
Native Language ſo fully as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and as that great oppoſition which this Doctrine hath found in a few years both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, hath rendred neceſſary. Neither have I publiſhed this as a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to any mans good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and intention;<note place="margin">—Si quid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſti rectius iſtis candidus imperti, ſi non bis utere mecum.</note> but rather to excite them, being conſcious to my ſelf, that there are very many can do it better few worſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo, good Sir, I return to you, whom I have held in a long ſuſpenſe, as to the chief ground of this <hi>Dedication;</hi> which is to revive the memory of your former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the unworthy Author, who owns and honours you as his loving and moſt obliging Patron: and hath given you this publick acknowledgment under his hand; ſo that if he ſhould at any time fail to anſwer them to the utmoſt of his
<pb facs="tcp:63172:8"/>
power, you may have an <hi>ex ore tuo</hi> to ſtop his mouth, while you make uſe of this as a rod of his own making to ſhame him to the world, and to ſcourge him the more ſeverely for his ingratitude.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have exceeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of an Epiſtle, but by its more then uſual length, I have ſaved the labour of a Preface. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with-hold you no longer from the ſight of the <hi>Glaſs,</hi> wherein you will ſee <hi>Loyalty</hi> (ſo far as my poor skill would ſerve me) drawn to the life, and that old deformed Hell-hag <hi>Rebellion</hi> arraigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, caſt, and condemned. And while a multitude of her advocates are crouding about her at the Bar, pleading hard for her pardon or reprieve, methinks I ſee you, and all loyal hearts upon the Bench, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the <hi>ſentence,</hi> and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> hath written a whole Book of <hi>Lamentations</hi> for the death of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Judah</hi> had great reaſon to lament the loſs of their good <hi>Joſiah;</hi> but we greater for the death of ours.</note> which was the fore-runner of thoſe many miſeries to the Jewiſh Church: and his Subjects expreſſed the ſenſe of their loſs by his fall, ſo deeply and pathetically, that it was made for an Ordinance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and propoſed as a Pattern for future times in their moſt important occaſions.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.11.</note> 
               <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63172:54"/>
of Megiddon.</hi> Surely it behoves us in our mourning (if poſſible) to exceed them. Their King <hi>Joſiahs</hi> fall was an effect of his own raſhneſs and folly; but the fall of ours was both by, and for our ſins. This (in ſhort) I commend as reflecting upon what is paſt,<note place="margin">Wholſome advice.</note> and propoſe this as a proper expedient for the time to come, to break off our Sins by Righteouſneſs, our former Rebellion by our future Fidelity. And ſith all our tears (were every one of our Eyes Fountains) would prove inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to reſtore to life, him whom ſome have been ſo eminently inſtrumental, and all have been one way or other acceſſary to bring him to his end; what we fell ſhort in duty to the dead Father, let us make up in love and loyalty to his living Son, his rightful Heir and Succeſſor; whoſe unparallel'd act of Grace (when we lay under the danger of ſo great a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture) cannot but indear him to all his rational Subjects; The benefit whereof I envy to none, but do heartily wiſh that ſome would ſtudy better to deſerve it. And ſo I paſs from this fear, here ſtrictly taken, as it ſignifies a particular duty which every individual Subject ows to his Prince; and come to conſider it in its latitude as more comprehenſive, including
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63172:54"/>
all other duties payable to him upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to any that ſtudy the Senſe as well as the Letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Fear,<note place="margin">Fear a very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Duty.</note> when it relates to God as its Object (as it doth here in the firſt place) oftentimes ſignifies his whole Worſhip;<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>6.13.</hi> Pſal. <hi>112.1, 128.1.</hi> Acts <hi>10.35.</hi> Qui timet Deum nihil negligit; timere Deum eſt nulla quae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienda ſunt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na praeterire. <hi>Greg.

               </note> as it doth in all thoſe places in the Margine. The Fear of the Lord makes a man very diligent and careful that he leaves no good duty undone which God would have him do; and it is as common in the Scripture, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to preſs the whole duty of Inferiors to their Superiors; to name onely ſome one leading duty, which being expreſſed, the reſt which are as it were under its command, muſt be underſtood; as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Parents, ſubmiſſion to Husbands, obedience to Maſters, as here Fear to Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>This (whether ye refer it to God or the King) is to all other Duties,<note place="margin">It is like the Heart.</note> as the Heart is to all the other parts of a man; and when God calls for that,<note place="margin">

It is not founded in themſelves, but in the relation they have to God. What a learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſaid of the Wives ſubjection to their Husbands, may be very well applied to the Subjects ſubjection to his Prince.

that her Husbands dignity, and her own inferiority, take not their eſtimate from Vertue, Nobility, or Riches, but from the Ordinance of God alone. The authority of the Husband, and the ſubjection of the Wife, is founded upon that, and may not, nay muſt not be abrogated or changed upon any of thoſe accidental accounts. There is indeed no other foundation that will ſupport the honour due unto Kings firm and unſhaken: for had it been ſaid <hi>Fear the King, (i. e.)</hi> the King ſo and ſo qualified; if ſuch qualifications be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or be ſuppoſed to be wanting (as it always will be by ſome or other that are diſaffected to his Perſon or Government) they would hereupon cancel all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of duty and reſpect to him, as we have found by late and ſad experience. Therefore the moſt wiſe God foreſeeing the miſchievous conſequences of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Laws among men (who for the moſt part make not their own or others eyes, but their partial affections Judges in the caſe) hath enacted an abſolute Law without any proviſoes or exceptions, to prevent all occaſions of publick diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> call for it to all Kings.</note> and pretences for rebellion. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Paul: Fear God, honour the King,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Peter.</hi>

be wanting, or be ſuppoſed to be wanting in the defence thereof (as he will always be ſuppoſed to be by ſome Sect or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) they then conceive themſelves (as well they may) from that condition, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from any obligation that that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant lays upon them (as Subjects) to protect and defend him as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; becauſe it binds them ſo to do, only upon that condition and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Yea, they will be ready to think themſelves thereby firmly engaged to their utmoſt to oppoſe him. To honour him for fear is ſervility, to do it for our own benefit, to work our ends upon him, is ſelf-love; and to do it with a reſerve or an implicite condition, is in plain terms, no other then implicite Rebellion.<note place="margin">The Authors actions the beſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their own Act.</note> The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of its Authors, were the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Comment upon their own Act; who had no ſooner brought his Subjects into that ſnare, but they baſely defamed the King as favourer of Popery; and an Army is levied to force him to a redreſs of their pretended grievances; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to no leſs then the unkinging of himſelf; the rooting out (ſo far as they could) that ancient Government of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, and the introducing a <hi>Linſey-Woolſey</hi> one in its ſtead, (as a learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

            <p>From whom they learned this, or what hand guided that pen, or what head-piece inſpired that Party that inſerted that Clauſe, is eaſie to gueſs; not Chriſt but Antichriſt; not <hi>Paul</hi> one of his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">That clauſe taken out of <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>

            <p>It is a thing more facile then proper for this my purpoſe, to diſcover more then this one flaw in that Politick Engine; which ſome have choſen rather to part with their livelihoods then renounce; though enjoyned to do it by a more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, and upon far better grounds, then that by which, and thoſe upon which it was firſt impoſed. It is the joint reſolution of all ſound Caſuiſts,<note place="margin">The reſolution of the beſt Caſuiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Vows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that ſinful vows are more ſafely broken then kept; and being raſhly and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly made, they bind to repentance, not to performance: which if our diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren of the Clergy, had well well weighed and conſidered, the Church might have received more benefit by their labours, and themſelves more comfort by their obedience. For how much ſoever they ſeem by their ſelected Texts for their Farewel Sermons, to pleaſe and ſolace themſelves in their ſufferings upon ſuch and ſuch accounts (as if they had left all to follow Chriſt) yet they cannot but know, that ſuch Texts have no more of comfort in them (at leaſt will yield no more unto them) then their ſufferings have of compliance with their Texts.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63172:102"/>
What a ſad miſtake will it be, if it ſhould prove in the winding up, that in ſtead of leaving all to follow Chriſt, they have left Chriſt to follow their fanſies, or the dictates of an erroneous Conſcience; and have oppoſed, yea preferred their own private reputations to the publick peace of the Church. For mine own part I do much more commend the prudence of thoſe Noble Senators, who (in regard it had bewitched ſo many Subjects into a Rebellion againſt their Soveraign) have paſſed upon it its proper doom, <hi>to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſhes.</hi>

            <p>But I leave them and come to our ſelves,<note place="margin">This applied to rectifie our judgments.</note> who are inſtructed from this part of the Text, that all the fore-mentioned Duties which Subjects owe to their Princes, are due and payable to them, as they are ſo. A Leſſon very neceſſary for us all to learn exactly, to remember it carefully, and to practiſe it conſcionably. Many are throughly convinced that they are juſtly due to, and highly deſerved by good Princes, that are tender Fathers of their Country, indulgent Nurſes of the Church, faithful Shepherds of the People, vigilant Keepers of the Peace, careful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Juſtice, and impartial prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of innocency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They readily pay
